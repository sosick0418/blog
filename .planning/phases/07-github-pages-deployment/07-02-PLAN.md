<objective>
Configure GitHub Pages in repository settings and verify initial deployment.

Purpose: Enable GitHub Pages deployment from GitHub Actions so the site is live and accessible.
Output: Live blog accessible at https://{username}.github.io/{repo}/ (or custom domain)

**Prerequisite:**
- 07-01 must be complete (workflow file committed and pushed)
- Repository must be on GitHub (not just local)

**Constraining decisions:**
- Free tier: GitHub Pages free hosting
- Deployment: GitHub Actions (not legacy branch-based deployment)
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Push workflow to GitHub and verify remote</name>
  <files>(git operations)</files>
  <action>
Ensure the repository has a GitHub remote and the workflow is pushed:

1. Check if remote exists: git remote -v
2. If no origin remote:
   - Inform user they need to create a GitHub repository first
   - Provide gh repo create command: gh repo create {repo-name} --public --source=. --push
3. If origin exists:
   - Verify main branch is pushed: git push origin main

This ensures the workflow file from 07-01 is on GitHub so Actions can run.

AVOID: Creating repository without user confirmation (they may have naming preferences)
  </action>
  <verify>git remote -v shows origin pointing to GitHub, git log origin/main shows recent commits</verify>
  <done>Repository is on GitHub with workflow file present</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Configure GitHub Pages in repository settings</action>
  <instructions>
I'll guide you through enabling GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. In left sidebar, click "Pages" (under Code and automation)
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - (This replaces the legacy "Deploy from branch" option)
5. Click "Save" if prompted

No additional configuration needed - the workflow will handle deployment automatically.

After saving, GitHub will run the workflow on the next push.

</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Trigger deployment and verify site is live</name>
  <files>(verification only)</files>
  <action>
Trigger a deployment and verify the site goes live:

1. Make a small commit to trigger workflow:
   - Add a comment or whitespace to any file
   - Or use: git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger initial deployment"
   - Push to main

2. Check workflow status via gh CLI:
   - gh run list --limit 5
   - Wait for workflow to complete

3. Get the deployed URL:
   - Default: https://{owner}.github.io/{repo}/
   - Check gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages for actual URL

4. Verify site loads correctly (basic check)

AVOID: Manual checking via browser (use curl or gh for automation)
  </action>
  <verify>gh run list shows successful deployment, curl to Pages URL returns 200</verify>
  <done>Site is live on GitHub Pages, homepage loads successfully</done>
</task>

</tasks>
